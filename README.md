# We are KWAD.space - A new Hackerspace in Tallinn, Estonia

A hackerspace is a physical place, run by people interested in various aspects of constructive & creative hacking. From finding ways to make your own beer to building a super-fast racing drone. We are a breeding ground for awesome ideas. We provide a nest where those ideas can become reality. We operate by collaboration and openness. We allow people to fail, and to try again.

The space operates within **the do-ocracy** system explained in [the hackerspace blueprint on GitHub](https://github.com/0x20/hackerspace-blueprint).
